## Usage

1. **Camera Access**: Allow camera permissions when prompted
2. **JPDB Integration**: (Optional) Set your jpdb.io API key for enhanced word analysis
   - Get an API key from [jpdb.io settings](https://jpdb.io/settings)
   - Click the "Setup API Key" button in the app to enter your key
   - With API key: Words are colored by difficulty and learning status
   - Without API key: Basic word splitting and dictionary lookup
3. **Capture Image**: Click the camera button to take a photo
4. **OCR Processing**: Click "Perform OCR" to extract text from the image
5. **Dictionary Lookup**: Click on any word in the OCR results to see dictionary information

## Deployment

The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Camera Permissions

This app requires camera access to function. Make sure to:
- Allow camera permissions in your browser
